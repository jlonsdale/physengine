# The final iteration of my physics engine project!

- my first physics engine (link https://github.com/jlonsdale/physics_engine.io) was purely based around velocity, this meant it could not handle variable acceleration)

- this engine is based around the forces acting on the ball & perfroms an integral approximation to get kinematic values
- we are using the Runge-Kutta method https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge%E2%80%93Kutta_methods to approximate

- Deployed here: https://physics-engine.herokuapp.com/

- i didnt really make this for anyone to use i just like making physics engines, but if you get a kick out of it thats great :D
